Welcome to my repository of helpful Unity code!

Currently added:
  - **EditorButton Attribute** - This attribute can be added to any method on a monobehaviour. This will make a button in the inspector appear and when clicked will call the method with the attribute. This is very helpful in debugging, testing, and prototyping! 
  - **Editor Todo List** - This is a custom todo list built using Unity's Editor API. Super helpful for keeping track of your next tasks! ![TODO LIST](https://github.com/WyattThornbury/UnityCodeSamples/blob/master/image.png)
